This page describes a Perl script I wrote for generating nicely formatted
slide shows via HTML pages.  It won't do all the work (you'll need an image
manipulation utility too), but it will make it pretty darn easy once you
have the photos sized properly.

<p class="normal">
You can grab the stuff you'll need here via this <a href="webshow.tar"><b>tar
file</b></a>.  Unpack it in the top-level directory where you want your
slideshow to reside. 
&nbsp; [Windows users note: WinZIP can unpack it for you] 
&nbsp; You'll also need to create a few directories, so the
resultant top-level directory will contain:

<code class="normal">
<pre>
	html            - Generated HTML pages will go here
	images          - Intermediate sized images go here
	originals       - Originals go here (unless you use the -o option)
	thumbs          - Thumbnail versions go here
	ButtonLeft.gif  - Buttons used by the pages
	ButtonRight.gif
	ButtonTop.gif
	webshow         - The webshow script itself
	webshow.css     - A CSS file used by the HTML pages
	myrename        - A quick-n-dirty Perl script to rename files
	filelist        - The ASCII text file that controls things
</pre>
</code>

<p class="normal">
It works like this: you put all your photos into the <u>originals</u>
directory.  Use a photo manipulation utility to create thumbnails in the
<u>thumbs</u> directory, and medium sized versions in the <u>images</u>
directory.  Thus for any given image, there will be three files, each with
the same identical name, in the three directories: thumbs, images,
originals.  The only difference in them will be their size in pixels.
I use a max of 100x100 for the thumbs, and 512x512 for the images.  You can
use whatever sizes you like, the script doesn't care.

<p class="normal">
If you don't want to bother with 3 sizes of each photo, you can omit the
<u>originals</u> directory and put the original photos instead directly
into the <u>images</u> directory.  In that case, you will run
<tt><b>webshow</b></tt> with the <tt><b>-o</b></tt> option -- 
thus it won't require an
<u>originals</u> directory, and won't turn the photos on the individual
HTML pages into links (as it would normally).

<p class="normal">
Then create the <u>filelist</u> file, which contains the names of the image
files, one per line.  I use the Unix command 
"<tt><b>ls -1 originals >filelist</b></tt>" or the MS-DOS command 
"<tt><b>DIR/B originals >filelist</b></tt>" to initially generate the
<u>filelist</u> file.

<p class="normal">
Then I edit the <u>filelist</u> file according to the following rules:

<ol class="normal">
<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
	All lines with a '#' character in column 1 are treated as comments
	and ignored.  Blank lines are also ignored, and can be used to 
	make the source more readable.
<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
	Lines beginning with a plus sign (+) are "magic" as follows:
	<table border=0 cellpadding=3 class="normal">

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>+TopPage: xxx</b></td>
	<td>Specifies the filename for the top level page (the default
	is <u>index.html</u>).  'xxx' is the filename.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>+TITLE: xxx</b></td>
	<td>Defines a title for the top-level Webpage.  The 'xxx' becomes the 
	text of the title.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>+DESCRIPTION: xxx</b></td>
	<td>Provides some textual description for the page, which appears
	right below the title.  'xxx' is the text.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>+COPYRIGHT: xxx</b></td>
	<td>A place for you to specify a copyright notice (the 'xxx' text)
	to be displayed
	at the bottom of every page.  See the example for the code to
	produce a copyright symbol.</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><b>+SECTION:&nbspxxx&nbsp|&nbspyyy </b></td>
	<td>Defines a section header, to break the top page into sections.
	The 'xxx' becomes an &lt;H2&gt; html tag, and the 'yyy' becomes
	the description below it.  You can leave out the 'yyy' part if you
	wish, but if you include it you must separate it from the 'xxx'
	part with a vertical bar (|).  </td></tr>
	</table>

	You don't have to include any of the above, but they are there to
	make the resultant Webpages more informative and useful.

<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
	Subsequent non-comment lines are assumed to contain the filename of
	an image.  These lines can contain descriptive text, which will 
	appear on the Web page generated for this photo.  A vertical bar '|'
	character separates the filename from the description.  The description
	is optional.
<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
	Any line may be 'continued' by indenting the following continuation
	line with a &lt;TAB&gt; character.  This is generally needed for the
	+SECTION: line, and the +DESCRIPTION: lines. See the example below.
</ol>

<h3>An Example</h3>
<div align="center">
<!-- img src="webshow.jpg" WIDTH=699 HEIGHT=577><br -->
<!-- img src="webshow2.jpg" WIDTH=610 HEIGHT=586><br -->
<img src="webshow.jpg" WIDTH=636 HEIGHT=821><br>
<p class="normal">
The example filelist below generates <a href="default.html"><b>this 
Web page</b></a>.
</div>

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<code>
<pre>
# ---------------------
# Example filelist file
# ---------------------
+TITLE: This is the Page Title
+DESCRIPTION: And this is the text at the beginning of the page.
	You can continue with as much text as you want here by indenting
	each line with a &lt;TAB&gt; character.  You can also put HTML here
	if you want.&lt;p&gt;
	Click on an image to start the show.  From there you can navigate
	forwards, backwards, or back here.  When you click on an
	image it will take you to a larger version.

The webshow script can be configured somewhat, see the first few lines in
the Perl script.  However, it does expect the input file <u>filelist</u> to
exist and be so named.  It also expects (and checks for) the proper
directories to exist.  It produces a single "I'm done" line noting how many
image files it found for which it generated Web pages.

<h3>What webshow does</h3>

<p class="normal">
Each time you run <tt><b><u>webshow</u></b></tt>
it reads the <u>filelist</u> file and
generates one HTML file in the <u>html</u> directory for every file listed
in the <u>filelist</u> file.  It also creates the top-level directory index
page (generally <u>index.html</u>).
It doesn't do anything with the image files, and doesn't even read the
image, thumbs, or originals directory.  So even if the image files aren't
there, it will still do its job -- though the resultant HTML pages will have
broken links.

<p class="normal">
If you run <tt><b><u>webshow&nbsp;-o</u></b></tt> instead, 
the only difference in
operation is that it won't expect there to be an <u>originals</u>
directory, and it won't generate any links to the large-sized photos that
would normally be stored there.

<p class="normal">
The 'development cycle' I use is to edit the <u>filelist</u> file, then run
<u>webshow</u>, then look at the Web pages just generated,
and repeat until I'm satisfied with the results.

<p class="normal">
Examples:
<p>
<ul>
<table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td> <tt><b>webshow</b></tt> </td>
	<td class="normal"> <i> -- the 'normal' case</i> </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <tt><b>webshow -o</b></tt> </td>
	<td class="normal"> <i> -- omit the 'originals' directory and 
	links to it</i> </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <tt><b>webshow whatever.html</b></tt> </td>
	<td class="normal"> <i> -- create 'whatever.html' instead of the 
	default (index.html)</i>
	</td> </tr>
</table>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol class="normal">
<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
	You can omit photos from the show by simply deleting the appropriate
        line in the <u>filelist</u> file.

<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
     You can rearrange the order in which the photos are displayed by
		rearranging the lines in the <u>filelist</u> file.

<li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">
    Feel free to modify the CSS file <a href="webshow.txt">webshow.css</a>
	to suit your tastes.  The version included here suits me, but you 
	may prefer another style.
</ol>

<h3>Obtaining Perl</h3>
<p class="normal">
Linux/Unix users already have Perl.  For you Windoze folks, 
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/index/">
ActiveState</a> has a fine port pre-compiled for various flavors of
Windows.  I've successfully used the Windows version of Perl to create 
slideshows with this version of <u>webshow</u> on Win98SE, Win2k and
Windows XP Pro systems.  There are also ports of Perl for the Apple
(various operating systems).

<h3>Other tools</h3>
<p class="normal">
I used two tools to generate the images and thumbnails, and found 
<a href="http://www.lview.com/">LVIEW-PRO</a> (in batch mode)
to be the easy way to go.  I liked WEB IMAGE GURU as it did "smart"
thumbnails, allowing you to thumbnail just the "important" part of the
photo, but it didn't always work right and took forever.  [my friend
Lee prefers a utility called 
<a href="http://www.acdsystems.com/english/products/acdsee/acdsee-node.htm">
ACDSee</a>].  
You can get functional eval copies from 
<a href="http://www.tucows.com">Tucows</a> 
or <a href="http://www.downloads.com">downloads.com</a>.
Just about any tool that will create thumbnails in batch mode will work
fine -- you can even do it by hand if necessary, you only have to do it
once...

<p class="normal">
Michael Bain contributed a script which I have named
<tt><u><b>mikes-script</b></u></tt> and included in the
<a href="webshow.tar"><b>tar file</b></a>.
It uses the ImageMagick package (commonly found on Unix/Linux
systems) to auto-generate the <u>thumbs</u> and <u>images</u> files, given the 
<u>originals</u> directory is populated with your photos.
It's very short, and you can easily modify it to suit your needs.

<p class="normal">
Thanks to Jack Tavares for the enhancement to add a
user-specifiable copyright notice.

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p class="normal">
It is really pretty simple to use, once you get the hang of it.  If you
make anything more than minor changes to 'webshow', I'd appreciate it if
you 
<a href="mailto:hmarc@micapeak.com">send me</a> a copy.  Thanks!

<p class="normal">
BTW -- There's a real-life example implementing a slideshow of an
<a href="http://www.micapeak.com/WetLeather/tours/alps2001/marc/">
Alps tour</a> I did in 2001.  It used an early-release (Aug-2001) version of
<u>webshow</u>.
Another more current version is a trip to 
<a href="http://www.micapeak.com/rides/Baja-2004/">
Baja, Mexico by motorcycle</a> which I did in March of 2004.
